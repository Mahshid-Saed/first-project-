                <p align="center" style="font-size:20px;">Rock, also called rock and roll, rock & roll, or rock ’n’ roll, form of popular music that emerged in the 1950s.The Canadian government defined “rock and rock-oriented music” as “characterized by a strong beat, the use of blues forms and the presence of rock instruments such as electric guitar, electric bass, electric organ or electric piano.”Rock and roll has been a huge cultural force since it burst upon the musical scene in the 1950s. Not only has it dramatically altered the evolution of popular music, it has influenced fashion, human behavior, and cultural norms in general.Traditionally, rock music has been especially popular among younger adults and teenagers. The music was associated with rebellion and youth. In 2017, however, for the first time, R&B and hip-hop became the most dominant genre in the US, according to Nielsen Music, surpassing rock music. Yet while many have turned their backs on the genre, and the list contains relatively fewer recent acts compared with the more established, classic rock bands, rock and roll is still alive and well.Using a number of different metrics, 24/7 Wall St. has identified the 100 most popular rock bands of all time. The selection of these artists is based on measures such as record sales, Billboard performance, Wikipedia page views, and popularity on the online streaming platform Spotify.</p>

                <p align="center" style="font-size:20px ;">Rock music from the Clinton era was diverse— loud, quiet and loud again. And the personalities were even louder. With a bit of suburban angst and self-effacing wit, the top rockers of the 1990s etched their places in history.Rock’s central appeal as a popular music has been its ability to provide globally an intense experience of belonging, whether to a local scene or a subculture. Rock history can thus be organized around both the sound of cities (Philadelphia and Detroit, New York City and San Francisco, Liverpool and Manchester) and the spread of youth cults (rock and roll, heavy metal, punk, and grunge).Rock is better defined, then, by its eclecticism than by reference to some musical essence, and it is better understood in terms of its general use of technology rather than by its use of particular instruments (such as the guitar). Early rock-and-roll stars such as Presley and Buddy Holly depended for their sound on engineers’ trickery in the recording studio as much as they did on their own vocal skills, and the guitar became the central rock instrument because of its amplified rather than acoustic qualities. Rock’s history is tied up with technological shifts in the storage, retrieval, and transmission of sounds: multitrack tape recording made possible an experimental composition process that turned the recording studio into an artist’s studio; digital recording made possible a manipulation of sound that shifted the boundaries between music and noise. Rock musicians pushed against the technical limits of sound amplification and inspired the development of new electronic instruments, such as the drum machine. Even relatively primitive technologies, such as the double-deck turntable, were tools for new sorts of music making in the hands of the “scratch” deejay, and one way rock marked itself off from other popular musical forms was in its constant pursuit of new sounds and new sound devices.</p>
